| Sep 3 | 2:30-3pm  |                    I did a lot of brainstorming and got to the point of solving the problem without any snakes or ladders |
| Sep 4 | 4-4:30pm  |                     More brainstorming, contemplating the BFS method for this, but don't exactly know how to implement it |
| Sep 4 | 6:45-7:30 | I implemented all of the snakes, ladders, and normal spots into a array, hopefully from this I can create a queue for BFS |
