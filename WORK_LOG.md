| Sep 3 |   2:30-3pm    |                                           I did a lot of brainstorming and got to the point of solving the problem without any snakes or ladders |
| Sep 4 |   4-4:30pm    |                                            More brainstorming, contemplating the BFS method for this, but don't exactly know how to implement it |
| Sep 4 |   6:45-7:30   |                        I implemented all of the snakes, ladders, and normal spots into a array, hopefully from this I can create a queue for BFS |
| Sep 6 |  11:45-12am   |                                              I implemented more of the BFS, trying to do the same thing as MazeSolver but its a little different |
| Sep 7 |  9:15-9:45am  | I thought I finished the BFS but I think the way I am counting the amount of values is wrong, maybe I should try doing an array to count instead |
| Sep 9 | 11:30-11:55am |      I was finally able to finish the code, what I did was change the count variable from an int to a array of ints which helped solve the issue |
