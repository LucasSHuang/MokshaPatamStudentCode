| Sep 3 |  2:30-3pm   |                                           I did a lot of brainstorming and got to the point of solving the problem without any snakes or ladders |
| Sep 4 |  4-4:30pm   |                                            More brainstorming, contemplating the BFS method for this, but don't exactly know how to implement it |
| Sep 4 |  6:45-7:30  |                        I implemented all of the snakes, ladders, and normal spots into a array, hopefully from this I can create a queue for BFS |
| Sep 6 | 11:45-12am  |                                              I implemented more of the BFS, trying to do the same thing as MazeSolver but its a little different |
| Sep 7 | 9:15-9:45am | I thought I finished the BFS but I think the way I am counting the amount of values is wrong, maybe I should try doing an array to count instead |
